# cuessz

the theory is that you could describe ssz types with some sort of schema defined by cue, and maybe this could be unified, and we could use it to generate thing across the ecosystem and have better testing and stuff? who knows.

the truth is that you can't do all the validation that you could possible want with just cue, but cue can do a good amount of it.

the rest i guess i will parse with go. so i guess if you want to use this with something other than go, you would have to write validators for that too?

idk. i write go. sorry!
